# Benchmarks
Non-COSINE Benchmarks
So yeah, this is a pretty basic project.

The City of Pickering kinda sucks and requires you to request their benchmarks one at a time, and only give you a basic static PDF to find the benchmarks you're looking for.

Those basic PDF's are: "OVERVIEW RURAL.pdf" and "OVERVIEW URBAN.pdf".  I've included them here.

In a stroke of luck after a passive aggressive email with the City of Pickering, I was able to get them to send me every single benchmark they have in their system.

I have taken it upon myself to encode and position them in a .kml file that you can import into Google Earth with no issues. You may be able to import them into any GIS software of your choosing, however compatibiliy may be an issue.

Coordinates are to GEN-1 Accuracy.  That is, they're Gud-E-Nuf and were basically positioned using google earth and my mouse.

Any benchmark that is GEN-2 accuracy will have been positioned with the use of a survey grade GPS, and you can assume their position is accurate to within 20cm. Note: I don't live in Pickering, I rarely work there, so I will not be doing any positioning myself.

IMPORTANT!!!
The file locations on my computer are in "D:/Benchmarks/Pickering/". You will need to do a find and replace in your favourite text editor to point the .kml file to the files on your computer.
